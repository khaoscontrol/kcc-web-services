# Getting Started

The API is very simple and uses a Push/Pull method. Data we export to you will be ``POST``ed to your defined endpoint and the data we import from you will be read from a URL you specify. Both of these requests will either be in ``JSON`` or ``XML`` and are defined in your configuration file

When we push data to you, you must ensure that you give a valid response code in the header, these can either be:

+ 200 (OK)
+ 400 (Bad request or bad data sent)
+ 500 (Error)

Error codes will make the API try again, therefore if you do not respond with a 200(OK) you experience duplicate data.

# Config File

Your configuration file should be accessible via a URL that is specified within the Khaos Control Cloud application. Once our API knows about this file it will cache it once a day, or you can force a manual update from within Khaos Control Cloud. 

**Please note** - The ``Configuration URL`` field on the channel setup must be pointing to either a JSON or XML file, not to a webpage endpoint in order for the information to be picked up correctly. 

As part of the configuration file retrieval, the API sends a GET request to it with an Authorisation Header, as below:

```Authorization: Basic [Username:Password encoded as Base 64 string]```

Using the Username and Password fields defined within the channel in Khaos Control Cloud. 

For example, a username of "khaos" and a password of control would be sent as:
```Authorization: Basic a2hhb3M6Y29udHJvbA==```
This allows you to prevent unauthorised access to your configuration file.

To force a manual update of the channel's configuration file, you will need to change the ``Configuration URL`` field within Khaos Control Cloud, save the document, and then change it back to what it was originally.

## Structure

The data structure must be wrapped inside an ``EndpointConfig`` property and can consist of one or more of the following objects:

Object | Property | Required | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
**[OrderDownload](#order-download)** | | Yes | The endpoint for where your orders can be imported into Khaos Control Cloud
| | URL | Yes | The URL of the endpoint, where data is POSTed for you to process
| | Frequency | Yes | How frequently (, in minutes,) the endpoint will be contacted
| | Format | Yes | The format of the file you have produced, either ``XML`` or ``JSON``
**[OrderStatusUpload](#order-status-upload)** | | | The endpoint of where the status information will be POSTed to
| | URL | | The URL of the endpoint, where data is POSTed for you to process
| | Format | | The format of which to export the information, either ``XML`` or ``JSON``
**[StockStatusUpload](#stock-status-upload)** | | Yes | This will define the endpoint to sync Stock Statuses
| | URL | Yes | The URL of the endpoint, where data is POSTed for you to process
| | Format | Yes | The format of which to export the information, either ``XML`` or ``JSON``
**[StockUpload](#stock-upload)** | | Yes | The endpoint of where stock is exported to, so you can update this on your website. See ``StockExport`` for details on the data being exported to you
| | URL | Yes | The URL of the endpoint, where data is POSTed for you to process
| | Format | Yes | The format of which to export the information, either ``XML`` or ``JSON``
**[CReturnDownload](#customer-return-download)** | | | The endpoint for where your customer returns can be imported into Khaos Control Cloud
| | URL | | The URL of the endpoint, where data is POSTed for you to process
| | Frequency | | How frequently (, in minutes,) the endpoint will be contacted
| | Format | | The format of the file you have produced, either ``XML`` or ``JSON``
**[ProvidedStock](#stock-upload)** | | | The endpoint from which Khaos Control Cloud can pull stock data from for download into the system. See ``StockChanges`` for details on how you should export your data.
| | URL | | The URL of the endpoint, where Khaos Control Cloud GETs data from you for import
| | Format | | The format of information that you export, either ``XML`` or ``JSON``
**[PriceListUpload](#price-list)** | | | The endpoint where Khaos Control Cloud will push pricelist data to you. These price lists contain relevant structured prices for various tsock items, as set up within Khaos Control Cloud
| | URL | | The URL of the endpoint, where data is POSTed for you to process
| | Format | | The format of which to export the information, either ``XML`` or ``JSON``

Note that the sub-properties (URL, Format, Frequency) are required if the parent endpoint is specified. For simplicity's sake, only the endpoints that are essential and their sub-properties are noted as required above.

## Example

```xml
<EndpointConfig>
    <OrderDownload>
        <URL>http://siriongenerictest.azurewebsites.net/api/Orders</URL>
        <Format>XML</Format>
        <Frequency>15</Frequency>
    </OrderDownload>
    <OrderStatusUpload>
        <URL>http://siriongenerictest.azurewebsites.net/api/OrderStatus</URL>
        <Format>XML</Format>
    </OrderStatusUpload>
    <StockStatusUpload>
        <URL>http://siriongenerictest.azurewebsites.net/api/StockStatus</URL>
        <Format>XML</Format>
    </StockStatusUpload>
    <StockUpload>

        <URL>http://siriongenerictest.azurewebsites.net/api/CustomerReturn</URL>
        <Format>JSON</Format>
        <Frequency>15</Frequency>
    </CReturnDownload>
    <ProvidedStock>
        <URL>http://siriongenerictest.azurewebsites.net/api/CustomerReturn</URL>
        <Format>JSON</Format>
    </ProvidedStock>
</EndpointConfig>
```

# Security

It is advised that all endpoints are secured via HTTPS. The API also supports HTTP Basic Authentication for all operations, it is recommended that these values are validated accordingly. Basic Auth can be setup within the KC application/channel screens of KCC.

# Data Continuity
You may need to keep track of what data has been processed by us, especially when importing large quantity of orders or potentially recovering from an error. To tackle this, you can pass through a a HTTP Header called ``Sirion-Continuation``, this can have any value you like and will be passed back to you, as demonstrated in the following scenario:

> You have 1200 orders to import but you find it best to import 1000 at a time,  by passing through a Sirion-Continuation HTTP header with the value of 1000, the next time we request the orders you will be able to grab the reference of “1000” and make the following 200 orders available for import.

Our general expectation for this field, and what you will receive on your first contact with the API, is a datetime of the form 2019-12-31 12:00:00Z. This can be used by you to determine the last order you sent to KC/KCC and then only send us orders from that date forward, to reduce the amount of data you need to handle per request.

## Retrying Orders

Khaos Control Cloud allows you to retry the download of previously failed orders. When this happens Sirion will send a header to your endpoint called ``SpecificIDs``. When this is present in your headers you need to provide just the requested orders, rather than all of them.

> ``SpecificIDs: "AREF1531082922"``

If multiple orders are set to retry then the header will have multiple comma seperated values, for example:

> ``SpecificIDs: "AREF1530082911,AREF1531082912"``

# Types &amp; Objects

When a field is not required, the value provided must still be of the relevant data type. E.g. the Forename field isn't a required field against Contact objects, but if the Forename tag is provided the value must be valid string data. A null value will cause errors, therefore a blank string must be used in place of null values.

Alternatively the field can be removed from the data entirely and that will prevent errors from occurring.

## Types

### DataItem

The ``DataItem`` type can represent one of the following:

+ ID
+ Code
+ Name

Whichever item it represents, the value must be string data.

#### XML

When used as XML, the ``ID``, ``Code``, or ``Name`` are set as attributes on a node.

```xml
<CompanyClass ID="55" />
```

#### JSON

When used as JSON, the ``ID``, ``Code``, or ``Name`` are set as object properties.

```json
"CompanyClass": {
   "ID": "55"
},
```

### DateTime

The ``DateTime`` type is represented as a ``string`` using the RFC 3339 format without the timezone offset.

``2018-01-18T12:20:48``


### LockableDate

The ``LockableDate`` type is represented as an object

Name | Type | Required | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Date** | [``DateTime``](#datetime) | Yes | The date value
**Locked** | Boolean | No | Whether the date can be changed or not at a later time


### MappingType

The ``MappingType`` type is represented as a one of the following:

```
StockCode
OtherRef

WebCode
Automatic
```

### LinkedItemType

The ``LinkedItemType`` type is represented as one of the following:

```

```

### OrderStatus

The ``OrderStatus`` type is represented as one of the following:

```

### OneOf

The ``OneOf`` type means that only one of the properties in the specified ``object`` needs to present.

For example when ``OneOf[SourceReturnReference]`` is specified and you provide ``SOrderID``, the remaining properties (``SOrderCode``, ``AssociatedRef`` etc.) cannot be present.

## Objects

### Customer

The ``Customer`` object is made up of the following properties:

Name | Type | Required | Max Length | Description
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
**CreateNew** | String | Yes | N/A | Can either be ``IfNoMatch``, ``Always``, or ``Never``. This ensures that a new customer is created if one does not already exist, without a customer being assigned the order will not import
**CompanyClass** | [``DataItem``](#dataitem) | Yes | N/A | Which classification this customer is in. All customers **must** have a classification
**Currency** | [``DataItem``](#dataitem) | Yes | N/A | What currency this customer purchases items in. All customers **must** have a currency. This cannot be changed once a customer has transactions recorded against them
**OtherRef** | String | | 50 | A reference, which is unique for other users
**WebUser** | String | | 50 | The username of the user
**CompanyType** | [``DataItem``](#dataitem) | | N/A | The company classification, which can be set in the System Data area of Khaos Control Cloud
**CompanyName** | String | | 50 | Business/Company name for the customer. If left blank; e.g. for a residential consumer; Khaos Control will generate a company name from the contact details on the account
**WebsiteUrl** | String | | 50 | The URL of the customer's website
**SourceCode** | [``DataItem``](#dataitem) | | N/A | The sales source that should be imported with the order
**MailingStatus** | [``DataItem``](#dataitem) | | N/A | This can either be an ID or value. This goes against the Mailing Flag within Khaos Control Cloud
**TaxReference** | String | | 20 | The Tax Reference for the customer, typically a VAT number
**URN** | String | | N/A | Unique Reference Number for this customer. Exclude this tag unless you know that the customer already exists in Khaos Control with that reference, or you wish to create a new account and are sure no customer with that URN already exists
**TaxExempt** | Boolean | | N/A | This flag toggles whether the order will calculate tax or not. If excluded, the system will decide whether an order is taxable based on country and company setup within Khaos Control Cloud

### Address

The ``Address`` object is made up of the following properties:

Name | Type | Required | Max Length | Description
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
**Line1** | String | Yes | 35 | First line of the address; usually, although not always, contains house number and road name. Most couriers require this to be populated before a package can be shipped
**Line2** | String | | 35 | Second line of the address
**Line3** | String | | 35 | Third line of the address. Not all couriers support three address lines, so don't populate this unless needed
**Town** | String | Yes | 35 | Address town. Required by Khaos and all couriers
**County** | String | | 35 | County; not generally required for UK addresses, although may be a required part of the address for some overseas addresses
**Postcode** | String | | 10 | Address postcode. Technically not required, although the vast majority of countries/couriers require this
**Country** | [``DataItem``](#dataitem) | Yes | N/A | Country for this address. Each address is associated with a country, which can be different to the main country of the customer record
**Email** | String | | 100 | Email address for this address. In most cases, associating an email address with the contact makes more sense, but this field allows associating an email with the address as a whole.
**Telephone** | String | | 25 | Telephone number associated with this address. In most cases, associating a telephone with the contact makes more sense, but this field allows associating a number with the address as a whole - e.g. a telephone number for business
**Fax** | String | | 25 | Fax number for this address. Stored by Khaos for reference purposes, although rarely used
**Organisation** | String | | 50 | Company/Organisation name for this address. Seperate from the company placing the order! For example, you may wish to deliver an order to a work address for a different business
**ShowCompanyName** | Boolean | | N/A | Controls whether the 'Name' tickbox is ticked on the imported order. This controls whether the Company Name is shown on reports

### Contact

The ``Contact`` object is made up of the following properties:

### SalesOrder

The ``SalesOrder`` object is made up of the following properties:

Name | Type | Required | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Customer** | [``Customer``](#customer) | Yes | An object representing the customer that sales order relates to

### OrderHeader

The ``OrderHeader`` object is made up of the following properties:

Name | Type | Required | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
**AssociatedRef** | String | Yes | Order reference number. This **must** be unique amongst all orders from a given website/source. When sending updates for order status, the ``AssociatedRef`` will be passed back to the source website, so it can tell which order has changed
**OrderDate** | [``DateTime``](#datetime) | Yes | The date the order was **placed**.
**Site** | [``DataItem``](#dataitem) | Yes | Which site/location the order should be fulfilled from
**Agent** | [``DataItem``](#dataitem) | | Which sales agent to attribute the sale to
**Courier** | [``DataItem``](#dataitem) | | Which courier to ship the order with. Note that rules within Khaos Control may override this selection
**CourierGroup** | [``DataItem``](#dataitem) | | Which group of courier services to ship the order with; use this if you want to restrict Khaos Control to shipping via a group/type of courier(s), but allowing it to select which specific courier service to use based on courier rules. For example, a Khaos Control system might have a courier group of "Next Day", which selects from many different next day services depending on package size, weight and destination
**Keycode** | [``DataItem``](#dataitem) | | The keycode to use with this order
**SalesSource** | [``DataItem``](#dataitem) | Yes | The sales source of the order. For example, you could use "WEB". These sources must exist in Khaos Control. Please note that SalesSource does not support matching by Code.
**Client** | [``DataItem``](#dataitem) | |
**Website** | [``DataItem``](#dataitem) | |
**Brand** | [``DataItem``](#dataitem) | | The brand that the order is part of. Please note that Brand does not support matching by Code.
**InvoicePriority** | [``DataItem``](#dataitem) | | The priority setting for the invoice, which must exist in Khaos Control
**DiscountCodes** | Array[[``DataItem``](#dataitem)] | Yes | An array of discount codes for the order. If you want to use the alias codes, you must specify the code value, in which case the name will be ignored. Name is only useful to match on a (non alias) discount code
**OrderNote** | String | | The note for the order
**InvoiceNote** | String | | The invoice note for the order
**DeliveryDate** | [``LockableDate``](#lockabledate) | | Which date the order should be delivered on. If this field isn't locked, Khaos Control may recalculate it based on rules
**RequiredDate** | [``DateTime``](#datetime) | | The latest possible date the customer has indicated the order can arrive. Distinct from ``DeliveryDate``, this field implies the order could arrive earlier, whereas ``DeliveryDate`` implies a specific day the order must arrive on
**PONumber** | String | | Customer's PO (Purchase Order) reference. Usually relevant for business customers paying on account
**DeliveryCharge** | [``Price``](#price) | | Amount charged for delivery. If omitted, the system will calculate delivery (unlikely to be desirable for web orders.) To indicate free delivery, include this field and set either the Net or Gross values to 0.
**DeliveryTaxAmount** | Double | | This will allow you to specify the tax amount for the delivery charge, overriding any calculations that Khaos Control Cloud would normally do. If left blank, then it will be calculated by Khaos Control Cloud.
**RemainderOnAccount** | Boolean | | Setting this value to true and not including a payment line will ensure the order is imported as an account order against the customer.
**CalcMethod** | Integer | | Can either be ``0`` for Auto, ``1`` for Net, or ``2`` for Gross. Choose the best option based on the type of customer/order. This can potentially affect the total based on VAT rounding. Generally B2B will use Net calculation, where as B2C orders will use Gross. Note this can be defaulted by the customer's classification, and doesn't need to be set against every individual order
**ValueDiscount** | Double | | Gross discount to apply to the order
**SOrderCode** | String | | This cannot be imported, but is presented when orders are exported
**SOrderType** | [``DataItem``](#dataitem) | | This cannot be imported, but is present when orders are exported
**GrossTotal** | Double | | The final total value of the order. This is used to allow Khaos Control Cloud to automatically correct rounding differences that may have occurred during price calculations.
**CustomData** | String | | A field that can be used to store any additional information which is required when the Order Status is sent back to the channel. E.g. If a customer facing reference has been passed through as Associated Ref, the internal ID for the order could be stored here, and this will be added onto the Order Status information.
**Currency** | [``DataItem``](#dataitem) | | The currency of the order.
**VATReliefQualified** | Boolean | | This field can be used to mark an order as Vat Relief Qualified, meaning VAT will not be charged on items that are marked as VRQ in Khaos Control. 

### OrderItem

The ``OrderItem`` object is made up of the following properties:

Name | Type | Required | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
**SKU** | String | Yes | The code of the stock item being sold. May not actually be the stock code in Khaos Control; the ``Mapping`` controls how it locates an item in Khaos Control
**Mapping** | [``MappingType``](#mappingtype) | Yes | Controls how the SKU is used to locate a stock item in Khaos Control.
**Quantity** | Double | Yes | How many units of the item were sold. Do not use non-integer quantites unless specifically requested to do by the Khaos Control user
**StockDescription** | [``OrderItemDescription``](#orderitemdescription) | | Specify which description to place against this item; If omitted, the standard description against the stock item is used.
**ExtendedDescription** | Array[String] | Yes | Additional lines of description for the order item; for example, additional instructions/requests, or a gift message
**FreeItemReason** | [``DataItem``](#dataitem) | | If the item is free (zero price), a reason can be provided specifying why. Only set if requested to by the Khaos Control user
**ImportRef** | String | | Optional item reference from the website/source. Will be passed back in any future order updates
**WebItemRef** | String | | Second item reference from the website/source. Will be passed back in any future order updates
**Site** | [``DataItem``](#dataitem) | | The site that this item will be fulfilled from. Usually this isn't specified, and the site recorded against the entire order is used
**PackLink** | String | |
**UnitPrice** | [``Price``](#price) | Yes | Unit price, i.e. price for a single item. This is required for accurate pricing of orders.
**PercentDiscount** | Double | | Percentage discount to apply to the line. If specified, the unit price should be the price **before** discount.
**ValueDiscount** | Double | | Discount amount to apply to the line item. This is the preferred discount field to use against an item as it helps to prevent rounding differences. As per PercentDiscount, when using this field, the unit price will need to be the price before discount. For Khaos Control, this field can only be used for versions 8.190.36 onwards.
**MappingItem** | String | | If the mapping type is ``Barcode``, sets which barcode type to search in
**AlternateMapping** | Array[[``ItemMapping``](#itemmapping)] | | If the primary mapping fails to find a stock item, you can specify fall-back mappings to attempt

### OrderItemDescription

The ``OrderItemDescription`` object is similar to a [``DataItem``](#dataitem) but differs between ``XML`` and ``JSON`` outputs (see below).

Name | Type | Required | Description

## Order Status Upload

Defined as ``OrderStatusUpload`` in your ``configuration file``, the API will push information as a ``POST`` to the endpoint in your desired format. This will occur when an order has been moved through the Sales Invoice Manager in Khaos Control Cloud, and it will only send the statuses for the orders that it has downloaded from the web service.

### XML

Node | Child Node | Type | Always present? | Description
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
**OrderStatuses** | | | Yes | The root node of the XML file
| | **Statuses** | Array[[``SalesOrderStatus``](#salesorderstatus)] | Yes | A parent node containing all of the sales order statuses

## SagePay Example Card Payment

*Please note: When using SagePay forms integration it is NOT possible to perform refunds ect from Khaos Control once the payment has been taken.*

SagePay payments can be imported into KCC webservices and then authorised from within KCC and KC. To do that, the card payment must be filled in and have specific values. Please note there are two configs - one for Deferred or Authenticated (Preauth) Payments and one for Released or Authorised (Fully authorised) Payments. 

### Deferred or Authenticated (Preauth) Payments

Field | Value
--- | --- |
**IsPreAuth** | MANDATORY - must be set to true
**AuthCode** | MANDATORY - For Deferred this must be the pre-autorisation code returned by SagePay when the original call was made [TxAuthNo]. For Authenticate calls this should be the [Status] returned from SagePay (either AUTHENTICATED or REGISTERED).
**TransactionID** | MANDATORY - this must be the SagePay [VPSTxID]
**PreauthRef** | MANDATORY - this must be the value supplied by the website as the SagePay [VendorTxCode]
**Security Ref** | MANDATORY - this must be the SagePay [SecurityKey] NOTE: When using SagePay forms integration it is NOT possible to perform refunds etc from Khaos Control once the payment has been taken.
**AAVCV2Results** | OPTIONAL - but recommended, this should contain the AAV check result text [AVSCV2] from SagePay i.e. [ALL MATCH]
**AccountNumber** | OPTIONAL - but recommended, as this controls which Card Integration Account the payment is attached to. This will dictate which merchant account is contacted when making payments / refunds. If not populated is will default to 0 (the primary account).

### Released or Authorised (Fully authorised) Payments

Field | Value
--- | --- |
**IsPreAuth** | MANDATORY - must be set to false
**AuthCode** | MANDATORY - This must be the autorisation code returned by SagePay when the original call was made [TxAuthNo] (if no call is made, please use REGISTERED).
**TransactionID** | MANDATORY - this must be the SagePay [VPSTxID]
**PreauthRef** | MANDATORY - this must be the value supplied by the website as the SagePay [VendorTxCode]
**Security Ref** | MANDATORY - this must be the SagePay [SecurityKey] NOTE: Not available in SagePay Forms Integration - You cannot perform refunds using Khaos Control without this.
**AAVCV2Results** | OPTIONAL - but recommended, this should contain the AAV check result text [AVSCV2] from SagePay i.e. [ALL MATCH]
**AccountNumber** | OPTIONAL - but recommended, as this controls which Card Integration Account the payment is attached to. This will dictate which merchant account is contacted when making payments / refunds. If not populated is will default to 0 (the primary account).
